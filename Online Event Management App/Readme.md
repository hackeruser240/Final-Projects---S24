Abstract:

The given program is a comprehensive online event management system implemented in C++. Here are ten key points about the program:

Modular Design: The program is divided into several classes, each responsible for managing specific aspects of the event management system. These classes include Event, Ticket, Payment, UserAuthenticator, OnlineTicketingSystem, EventScheduler, VenueManager, SpeakerManager, FeedbackSurvey, Networking, Customization, and SocialMediaIntegration.

User Authentication: The UserAuthenticator class handles user authentication by verifying usernames and passwords against stored credentials. It also provides authorization based on user roles.

Event Management: The Event class represents an event with attributes such as name, date, and location. The EventScheduler class schedules events, and users can create, display, and schedule events through the main program.

Ticketing System: The OnlineTicketingSystem class manages the generation and display of tickets. Users can generate tickets by providing event details such as name, date, location, ticket type, quantity, and price.

Venue Management: The VenueManager class handles the addition and display of venue details, including name, location, and facilities.

Speaker Management: The SpeakerManager class manages speakers for events by adding them along with their topics.

Feedback System: The FeedbackSurvey class collects and displays feedback for events, allowing users to rate events on a scale of 1 to 10.

Networking: The Networking class facilitates networking among attendees by adding connections between them.

Customization: The Customization class allows customization of event pages by specifying branding elements, logos, and custom themes.

Social Media Integration: The SocialMediaIntegration class enables sharing event details on social media platforms and displays a social media feed.

Overall, the program provides a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of organizing and attending events, from user authentication to ticket generation, venue management, feedback collection, and social media integration.
