This code manages user accounts and various tasks related to a virtual system. It allows users to register with a username, password,
role, and email. After registration, users can log in and perform actions like adding students to classrooms, adding fees for students,
uploading homework, marking assessments, sending notifications to parents, creating events, and viewing all registered users. The program 
displays a menu where users can choose their desired action. It continues to run until the user chooses to exit.
