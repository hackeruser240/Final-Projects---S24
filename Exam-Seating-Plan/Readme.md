## Abstract:

The Exam Seating Plan System is a command-line program developed in C++ designed to generate exam seating plans based on the number of classes provided. It merges different classes and their student strengths into single halls, accommodating various class sizes. The system offers different seating plan templates including random, sequential, and mixed random. The mixed random plan organizes students evenly, followed by odd students, and then random placement, providing a balanced seating arrangement.

Key features include user registration and login functionalities, dependent on file management. Teachers, as administrators, require a specific key ("KEY") for registration to access administrative controls. Students can register and login to view the most recent exam plans published by administrators. The system also allows for backup of exam plans to new files, enabling easy retrieval and preservation of seating arrangements. Additionally, teachers have the ability to edit seating plans post-generation, facilitating modifications such as seat swaps and assignments.
