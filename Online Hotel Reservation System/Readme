Abstract:

The presented code implements a Hotel Reservation System through object-oriented programming in C++. It comprises classes and functionalities for managing various aspects of hotel operations, including administration, inventory management, room availability, booking, rate management, discounts, promotions, reporting, payments, user management, reviews, cancellation policies, payment systems, and room reservations.

The program begins with a menu-driven interface allowing users to interact with different features of the system. Administrators can access administrative functionalities such as displaying admin credentials. Inventory management enables tracking of available items and their prices. Room availability shows available rooms and their rates. Booked rooms display rooms that are already assigned to users. Rate management allows updating and retrieving room rates. Discounts and promotions can be generated and managed. Reports can be generated based on system data. Payments can be processed using various payment methods. Users can log in, and their information can be displayed. Search filters facilitate searching for specific room types. Booking rooms and submitting reviews are also supported functionalities. Cancellation policies and payment systems can be accessed and managed. Room reservations can be made with specified check-in and check-out dates.
